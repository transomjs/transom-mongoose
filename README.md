# transom-mongoose
Adding Mongoose support to a Transom REST API. Define mongoose models quickly and easily, then expose them through a comprehensive set of pre-built CRUD endpoints that are added to the API. Include custom logic in pre & post hooks, and apply auditing and ACL with built-in plugins.
